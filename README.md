### Run docker compose

To start the docker compose, on the root of project run: docker-compose up.
This should start 2 dockers: one with the backend and one with the frontend.

## How to use
In the browser write: http://localhost, to acces to the frontend

To get the api data, write in the browser (or in a postman request): http://localhost:3000/files/data

You can also run this curl in the terminal or import it on postman:

curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/files/data'

### Run frontend

To run the backend without docker, write in a terminal: npm run start
